# Movie Reviewer

An application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementing AJAX functions to send and receive information from the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API to obtain a chosen movie's image, ratings, length, and plot description. The user is able to see a variety of movies in a specific genre, and append that movie to their favorites list if they choose to re-watch the movie in the future.

</ul>
