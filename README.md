# Movie Reviewer

An application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementing AJAX functions to send and receive information from the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API to obtain a chosen movie's image, ratings, length, and plot description. The user is able to see a variety of movies in a specific genre, and append that movie to their favorites list if they choose to re-watch the movie in the future.

Check out my demonstration video [here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uayOPgz3RvMtt8uw6Gs2WeJOnyoI5GSk/view?usp=sharing)

Current Feature List:

User can input and see their naem on the home page's greeting section.
User can navigate to the home page and favorites page in the navbar.
User can browse the action genre movies.
User can view the movie's image, title, ratings, length, and description.

User can remove a movie from their favorites list.
Planned additions:

Implement a carousel effect so that more than 4 movies can fit within a genre.
What I learned from working on this project:

Building my own FIGMA wireframe.
Planning the issues, and the functionality that goes into a certain implementation idea.
Finding and implementing API keys from an external site.
Using XHR (XMLHttpRequest) and the request in order to input data and create jQueries based on the response given.
Making a "data unavailable" page whenever the user has not put any movies in the favorites section.
